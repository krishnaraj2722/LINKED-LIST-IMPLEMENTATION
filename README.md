Description: This project demonstrates a modular and efficient implementation of a Singly Linked List in the C programming language. A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains a data part and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

The implemented program supports the following key operations:

Insertion: Adds a new node at the end of the linked list. Dynamic memory allocation is used to handle data efficiently.

Deletion (by value): Removes the first occurrence of a node with the specified value from the list. It safely handles edge cases like deletion from the head or an empty list.

Traversal (Display): Iterates through the list and prints the value of each node in order, ending with NULL to indicate the end of the list.

Implementation Details: Each node is defined using a struct containing data (an integer) and a next pointer.

The list operations are handled through separate functions to promote modularity and code reusability.

Dynamic memory (malloc and free) is used to manage memory efficiently.

The code is structured to handle empty lists, single-element lists, and deletion of head/middle/tail nodes robustly.
